/**
 * Flotiq User API
 * ## Getting started   This is your Flotiq User API that allows you to access your data through the Content API that you defined.   ### Access to data   There are several methods that you can use to access your data:  * Live API docs - available via <code>Try it out</code> button available next to each endpoint   * Copying example code on the right side of each endpoint  * By downloading the SDKs available in mulitple languages.  * By downloading the Postman collection and importing it into Postman.    Each of these methods is described in length in the [user documentation](https://flotiq.com/docs/).   ### Authorization   In order to make use of the provided documentation, example code, SDKs and so on - you will need to pull out your API key. We recommend that you start with the ReadOnly API Key which will allow you to make all the `GET` requests but will error-out when you try to modify content. Please remember to replace the key for `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` calls.   It\'s also possible to use scoped API keys - you can create those in the API keys section of the Flotiq user interface. This will allow you to create a key that only authorizes access to a specific content type (or a set of content types, if you choose so). Read more about how to use and create API keys in the [API keys documentation](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/).   ## Object access   Once you define a Content Type it will become available in your Content API as a set of endpoints that will allow you to work with objects:   * create  * list  * update  * delete  * batch create  * retrieve single object.  ### Hydration   When you build Content Types that have relation to others your objects will optionally support hydration of related entities. The endpoints that support object retrieval accept a `hydrate` parameter, which can be used to easily fetch hydrated objects. Since this breaks the standard REST concepts - it\'s not enabled by default, but it\'s a very handy feature that allows to reduce the amount of HTTP requests sent over the wire and we strongly recommend to use it.
